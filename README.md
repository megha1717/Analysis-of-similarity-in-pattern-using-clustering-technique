The project relies on similarities in pattern. Some of the patterns from the nature is to be
analysed like Qutub Minar, Indian Carpet, Barnsley leaf. In all the patterns, there are similarities
in blocks of Qutub minar, patterns in leafs and symmetry view in the carpet. All the similarities
are going to be analysed by clustering technique i.e. K- Means clustering technique. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique which aims at grouping a set of objects
into clusters so that objects in the same clusters should be similar as possible, whereas objects in
one cluster should be as dissimilar as possible from objects in other clusters. Therefore, in this project we have considered the nature patterns and further to analyse
the similarities using k-means clustering techniques.
